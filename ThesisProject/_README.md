## Note to User
I would recommend looking at the conference poster first for an overveiw of the project, then reading
the abstract in the thesis itself. If those interest you and you want information beyong the surface
level, the rest of the thesis is at your disposal.

## Project Overview
This was my undergraduate honors thesis project, working under Dr. Matthew Traum and Alex Lacerna
in the UF GatorKits Lab. The goal of the project was to modify an OTS 3D printer to be equipped with a conveyor belt which would automatically eject parts and begin subsequent prints, allowing the printer
to run without human intervention so long as the filament spool does not run empty.
