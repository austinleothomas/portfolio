\BlackJackSim               Python-based blackjack program I wrote when learning the language.

\FlightController           Optimal PID autopilot controller, running a Gauss-Seidel coupled model
                            with flight simulation handlded in MATLAB / Simulink and model coupling
                            and numerical optimization handled in Python.

\OptimizationAssignments    Assignments for U-M AEROSP 588 Multidisciplinary Design Optimization. Most
                            consist of self-written numerical optimization algorithms tested on problems
                            of varying complexity and analyzed for performance and algorithm attributes.

\SolarDrone                 Years-long project under a student-led design team to design, manufacture,
                            and test a small (~ 4' wingspan) solar-powered drone. I served as the 
                            aerodynamcis lead for the team for several years, contributing heavily to
                            the MVP3 drone design.

\ThesisProject              My honors thesis project in the UF GatorKits Lab, under the direction of
                            Dr. Matthew Traum and Alexander Lacerna. The project involved modifying
                            an OTS 3D printer to equip it with a conveyor belt, the goal being to
                            automate part ejection and reduce the man-hours required for mass-manufacturing parts.
