DesignProposal_MVP3.pdf         This design deck was put together Dec '23 - Jan '24 by myself and
                                several undergraduate engineers working on my aerodynamics team.
                                The design is the result of a number of trade studies combined with
                                comstraints and requirements imposed by org leadership. The final
                                deliverable was a nondimensional aircraft geometry which was presented
                                to org leadership early Spring 2024, approved, and passed to the 
                                manufacturing team. The geometry was modelled in XFLR5.

DesignReview_MVP2.pdf           This is the final report for the MVP 2 (v2) solar drone design -- this
                                design was developed from Jan '23 - Dec '23, with this report being
                                published at the end of 2023. This report served to document the design
                                process and analyze successes and shortcomings of the final product. My
                                specific contribution was in authoring the "Aerodynamic Considerations"
                                and "CFD Simulations" sections (see p. 8 - 12).

## Note to User
The design proposal is much less dense and more visual, and constitutes my most significant contribution
to the project. If you are looking for more technical analysis, you may find the design review more
interesting. Though it should be noted that my contribution to the MVP2 design was strictly in post-design
analysis -- I was not on the team during the design and manufacturing stages of the MVP2 design.


## Project Overview
This project was a years-long effort to develop a solar drone under the student-ran design org
Real World Engineering. I joined the team as aerodynamics lead in Aug '23 and contributed to
second-semester work on the MVP2 design and full-lifecycle work on the MVP3 design. My work focused
on...

    (I)     design analysis (in XLFR5 and Autodesk CFD) of MVP2 and MVP3 designs

    (II)    designing nondimensional geometry of MVP3 desigm

    (III)   assisting manufacturing team in preserving structure required for flight

    (IV)    assisting drone pilot in understanding flighr envelope and vehicle handling

    (V)     leadership duties, including student development, semesterly recruitment, and team management
